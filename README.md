# FTBServer
Changes, extra modpacks, what to delete/change. etc.

Server is prompt based, no GUI. Lets it run faster on my computer. 
So, yes. I can just run the default twitch client, but it'l be hella slow when those reactors get rendered in....

Ensure your twitch modpack is version 3.0.2 not the latest versions, ill try and update the server later on.
